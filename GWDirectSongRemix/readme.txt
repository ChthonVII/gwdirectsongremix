This directory is used for music files extracted from gw.dat.

This is only necessary in some very limited circumstances:
1. The song is not included in the soundtrack; and
2. The song needs to be used in a place where the vanilla music is a playlist rather than a single track.

Absent #1, the high-quality track from the soundtrack should be used.
Absent #2, a `*` entry in GuildWars.ds should be used to defer back to vanilla music playback.

Volume needs to be adjusted by ear.
